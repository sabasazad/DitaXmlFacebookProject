        <p class="p">Have you ever wondered why people like using Facebook? After all, there are already a lot
            of other ways to communicate online, like through email, instant messaging, and so on.
            What makes Facebook unique is the ability to <strong class="ph b">connect and share</strong> with the people
            you care about at the same time.</p>
        <p class="p">For many, having a Facebook account is now an expected part of being online, much like
            having your own email address. And because Facebook is so popular, other websites have
            worked to <strong class="ph b">integrate Facebook</strong>. This means you can use a single Facebook account to
            sign in to different services across the Web.</p>
